## This package allows to pass network objects to [`ggplot2`](http://ggplot2.org/), along with several geometries to plot their elements.

__Install from CRAN__, or from GitHub with `devtools`:

```r
# stable
install.packages("ggnetwork")

# dev
devtools::install_github("briatte/ggnetwork")
```

__IMPORTANT: the `ggnetwork` package depends on `ggplot2` version 2.0.0 or above.__

* * *

__The package vignette__ contains [detailed examples](https://briatte.github.io/ggnetwork/) of how to use its fortify method and each of its geometries.

__For further examples__ that use `ggnetwork` with other packages to produce animated graphs, see James Curley's slides on “[Interactive and Dynamic Network Visualization in R](http://curleylab.psych.columbia.edu/netviz/).”

__Comments and suggestions__ are very welcome: please file them as [issues](https://github.com/briatte/ggnetwork/issues).
